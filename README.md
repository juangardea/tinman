## Pentesting Report

1. (Required) Vulnerability Name or ID
  - [X] Summary: I copied the youtube video URL and used the embed shortcut to create the attack. I was able to recreate the attack because backlash charaters are filtered out using HTML sanitazion function wp_kses() and it does not consider the escape sequences like \x3c that correspons to < and >.
    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: WP 4.2
    - Fixed in version: latest
  - [X] GIF Walkthrough: <img src="https://github.com/juangardea/tinman/blob/master/XSS1.gif" width="800">
  - [X] Steps to recreate: Log in to word press as admin. Create new post and copy [embed src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_nIIcKTxGk\x3csvg onload=alert(1)\x3e'][/embed] into the text field. Then Submit the post and view.
